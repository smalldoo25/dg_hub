    <p><i><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:107%'>DeftAgile’s
    Quad Track Product Pipeline. The pipeline is one simple workflow for a single
    product team and not four silo teams. The Quad Track approach is for the sole purpose
    applying the right data, finding, insights, metrics and the use of AI (tool) to
    each track areas. Our framework is tailored <b>Quad-track Agile</b>, or <b>continuous
    discovery models</b>, where hypothesis-driven development and user-centred
    design are prioritised, it is also compatible with <b>traditional or scaled
    Agile product development</b>, especially in <b>enterprise environments</b>
    where governance, budgeting, and cross-functional coordination are critical.</span></i></p>

    <p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

    <p>DeftAgile is
        a product and innovation-focused, customer-centric agile framework that bridges
        insight, intent, and execution.  It was born from a simple yet powerful belief:
        products should start and end with the customer; no exceptions.</p>

    <p>At its core,
        DeftAgile is built to help organisations craft, evolve, and scale products and
        services of the customer, by the customer, and for the customer. It reimagines
        agility not just as faster delivery, but as a strategic function of relevance,
        co-creation, and continuous learning<b>.</b></p>

    <p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Designed to
                    Close the
                    Discovery–Delivery Divide</span></i></b></p>

    <p>One of
        DeftAgile’s central commitments is reshaping how discovery works. Traditional
        workflows too often isolate product thinking to “the top” which is far from the
        developers building the experience. This leads to misalignment, wasted cycles,
        and a blurred understanding of the “why.” DeftAgile integrates product
        managers, engineers, researchers, and customers early and often meaning, context
        flows freely, and teams are empowered to make decisions</p>

    <p>No more
        product owners acting as proxies. No more building in the dark. DeftAgile
        democratises discovery and aligns everyone behind a shared, validated
        understanding of value.</p>

    <p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Customer-Driven
                    Delivery, without

    <p>Serving the
        customer isn’t just about being reactive, it is also about architecting ways of
        working that bring teams and customers together, continuously.</p>

    <p>DeftAgile
        enables fast feedback loops and value-first delivery, balancing quality, time
        to market, and outcome orientation. It empowers teams to optimise flow, reduce
        cognitive overload, and deliver meaningful increments that reflect what users
        truly care about.</p>

    <p>“Deft” means
        nimble, and the framework lives up to its name. By identifying and eliminating
        waste in value streams, DeftAgile supports lean, focused delivery pipelines
        that avoid unnecessary overhead and prioritise what matters.</p>

    <p>This
        includes not only reducing delays and excess handoffs, but also embracing
        adaptable governance, transparent metrics, and context-rich rituals that evolve

                    Meets Evidence</span></i></b></p>

    <p>Innovation
        is not an afterthought; it is the engine.  DeftAgile centres data-driven
        insights, experimentation, and AI-enhanced decision-making across the entire
        product lifecycle. It helps teams synthesise qualitative signals, surface
        customer truths, and shape hypotheses that drive intentional, validated
        learning.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The goal? To
        consistently wow customers with products that feel intuitive, tailored, and
        timely.</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-value-customer-centricity">Customer
                Centricity</h3>

    <p><i>Build what matters. Obsess over value.</i></p>

    <p>Customer centricity means putting real customer needs and not
        assumptions at the heart of our work. Product and Agile teams at DeftAgile are
        expected to deliver not just functionality, but impact. That requires proximity
        to customers, data-informed decision-making, and relentless validation.</p>

    <p>Here's how we embed customer centricity:</p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'><b>Understand the Customer</b></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
        margin-left:36.0pt'>Define clear personas and segment behaviours. Use research,
        interviews, and observations to uncover real pain points, which is used in building
        deep customer empathy that informs everything from backlog items to
        go-to-market strategy.<br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'><b>Test Hypotheses Early</b></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'>Use techniques like Pretotyping/prototyping, MVPs, and A/B
        testing to validate ideas quickly and cheaply. Embrace learning loops and
        measure what moves the needle for the customer and not just vanity metrics.<br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'><b>Align Vision to Customer Outcomes</b></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'>Roadmaps should flow from customer insights, not internal

    </p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'><b>Iterate with Purpose</b></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-value-collaboration-empathy">Collaboration
                and Empathy</h3>

    <p><i>Work together, not in silos. Lead with respect.</i></p>

    <p>At DeftAgile, we reject the blame game and operate from a
    core belief: <b>collaboration is an act of empathy</b>. Great teams aren’t
    built by accident, they're shaped through shared purpose, psychological safety,
    and mutual respect. Product managers and engineers are not rival camps; they
    are one team, solving complex problems together.</p>

    <p>Here’s how we embody this principle:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Shared
                Power, Shared Purpose</b> Product and engineering leads have equal
            influence. Decision-making is collaborative, balancing feasibility and
            value creation without power imbalances.</li>
        <li><b>Trust Is
                the Default</b> We assume positive intent. Trust is earned through
            consistency and openness, where teams can admit risks, ask hard questions,
            and rely on each other under pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Unite
                Under One Goal</b> Our shared accountability is simple: build the right
            thing, in the right way. This means rallying around product outcomes and not
            functional boundaries.</li>
        <li><b>Empathy in
                Action</b> We embrace each other’s realities. Engineers understand product
            constraints; PMs understand technical trade-offs. Everyone is curious
            about the “why” behind the “what.”</li>
        <li><b>One Team,
                Always</b> Cross-functional by design, our teams inspect and adapt as a
            unit. Win or fail, we own it together. Respect is non-negotiable, and
            feedback flows in all directions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-value-transparency-communication">Transparency
                and Communication</h3>

    <p><i>Clarity is kindness. Visibility drives trust.</i></p>

    <p>At DeftAgile, we don’t believe in closed doors or hidden
        roadmaps. High-performing teams thrive on open communication within the team,
        across departments, and throughout the organisation. Transparency isn’t an
        optional “nice-to-have”; it’s a strategic enabler of speed, alignment, and
        psychological safety.</p>

    <p>This is how we practice it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Open,
                Daily Dialogue</b> Communication must be continuous and frictionless. PMs
            and engineers engage daily in open conversations. Whether in stand-ups,
            async updates, or strategy syncs.</li>
        <li><b>Alignment
                Across Functions</b> We extend transparency to every part of the value
            chain: product marketing, design, data, customer success, and subject
            matter experts. Collaboration starts at discovery and not after the
            roadmap drops.</li>
        <li><b>Stakeholder
            Rituals with Purpose</b> Visioning and planning workshops are more than
            checkpoints, they’re also co-creation spaces where teams align on
            priorities and surface risks early. Reviews are inspection points to adapt
            with agility.</li>
        <li><b>Context
                &gt; Consensus</b> We don’t aim for endless agreement. Instead, we share
            the full picture: why a decision was made, what trade-offs were accepted,
            and how success will be measured.</li>
        <li><b>Feedback
                Is a Signal, Not a Threat</b> Every comment, whether from a teammate or
            customer, is data. Teams actively seek feedback and treat it as a gift,
            feeding it back into iteration cycles with humility.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-value-innovation-flexibility">Innovation
                and Flexibility</h3>

    <p><i>Challenge the norm. Adapt with
            intent.</i></p>

    <p>Innovation isn’t luck, it’s built
        into how we work. At DeftAgile, we don’t wait for perfect conditions to try
        something bold. We make room for creative exploration in the constraints of
        delivery. We’re not just adaptable; we’re proactive shapers of change.</p>

    <p>Here’s how that translates on the
        ground:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Experiment Relentlessly</b>
            Prototype, test, tweak, repeat. Whether it’s a business model shift or a
            tiny UI change, small bets drive meaningful discovery.</li>
        <li><b>Learn Fast, Evolve Faster</b>
            Failure isn’t a dead end, it’s a feedback signal. We create safe-to-fail
            environments where teams can run experiments, learn swiftly, and share
            outcomes transparently.</li>
        <li><b>Innovation for the Right
            Reasons</b> Not all novelty is progress. We innovate with purpose, and we
            also make sure it is tied to unmet customer needs, untapped growth opportunities,
            or process breakthroughs.</li>
        <li><b>Stay Adaptable at the Edges</b>
            Flexibility means we’re always ready to pivot, reframe a problem, or
            re-scope a feature when the data tells us to. We shift gears without
            losing sight of our vision.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-value-accountability-ownership">Accountability
                and Ownership</h3>

    <p><i>Own the outcome. Act with
            autonomy.</i></p>

    <p>True accountability means
        everyone, from product, design and  engineering, feels responsible for
        delivering value. We don’t pass the buck or wait to be told. Ownership is how
        we build trust, scale decisions, and hold the bar high.</p>

    <p>Here’s how we make that happen:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Shared Accountability, Clear
            Roles</b> Everyone contributes to outcomes, but we’re also crystal clear
            on who’s driving what. That clarity empowers speed and focus.</li>
        <li><b>Autonomy with Boundaries</b>
            Teams make the decisions that are theirs to own. They manage their scope,
            pace, and trade-offs which is guided by shared goals and product vision.</li>
        <li><b>Measure What Matters</b>
            Teams succeed when they know what success looks like. We define OKRs,
            KPIs, and customer metrics that align individual and team accountability
            with business impact.</li>
        <li><b>Speak Up, Show Up</b>
            Ownership includes raising flags, owning misses, and learning out loud.
            Leaders model this in public, and teams follow suit.</li>
        <li><b>Celebrate the Climb</b> We
            recognise both the milestones hit and the tough decisions made along the
            way. Accountability is culture-building, and not compliance tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="dguide-principles-data-northern-star">Let Data
                be Your Northern Star</h3>

    <p>Data is the foundation of innovation, guiding product
        decisions from ideation through to execution. As a product manager or Agile
        expert, embracing a data-driven approach isn’t just a choice, it's a necessity.
        Data helps you navigate shifting market trends, understand user preferences,
        and pinpoint opportunities with precision. It's not just about crunching
        numbers; it’s about interpreting those numbers as the stories that shape your
        product’s journey.</p>

    <p>We use data to drive every major decision, from discovery to
        engineering, helping us align product features with business objectives and
        customer outcomes. This means understanding the lifecycle of data through its
        stages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Raw Data</li>
        <li>Findings</li>
        <li>Insights</li>
        <li>Metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Establishing the right metrics tied to business goals and
        customer outcomes is critical. Data also plays a key role in validating
        hypotheses, whether through A/B testing, cohort analysis, or prototyping
        insights. In essence, data helps prioritise features, validate assumptions, and
        measure the success of iterations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 id="dguide-principles-hypothesis-testing-validation">Hypothesis
                Testing &amp; Validation</h3>

    <p>How do we foster a culture of rapid experimentation and
        learning? Simple: we encourage teams to innovate by taking calculated risks,
        running small-scale experiments, and iterating swiftly based on feedback. The
        real value comes in continuously reflecting on processes and outcomes, which
        empowers teams to improve with each iteration.</p>

    <p>A scientific approach to product development offers clear
        benefits. Teams identify assumptions about user behaviour, feature impact, and
        business outcomes and transform them into testable hypotheses before diving
        into product development. Here's how we do it:</p>

    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
        <li>Hypothesis Formulation: Define clear, testable hypotheses
            with:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>The
            proposed change or action</li>

        <li>The
            expected impact or outcome</li>

        <li>The
            metrics for success</li>

        <li>A
            timeline for evaluation</li>

        <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=2 type=1>
            <li>Minimum Viable Experiments: Design small experiments (A/B
                tests, prototypes, MVPs) to test each hypothesis, ensuring minimal
                investment but meaningful data.</li>
            <li>Data Collection &amp; Analysis: Collect and analyse both
                quantitative data and qualitative feedback to evaluate results
                comprehensively.</li>
            <li>Rapid Iteration: Quickly decide whether to pivot,
                persevere, or abandon the idea based on results, with lessons learned
                fuelling the next round of experiments.</li>
            <li>Knowledge Sharing: Share experiment outcomes, both
                successes and failures across the team. This builds collective knowledge
                and ensures everyone is aligned.</li>
            <li>AI-Enhanced Hypothesis Generation: Use AI to analyse past
                data, user behaviours, and market trends to generate potential hypotheses.
                This not only speeds up the testing process but also uncovers non-obvious
                opportunities.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>By embedding hypothesis-driven development into the Agile
            framework, we:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduce the risk of building features that don’t deliver
                value</li>
            <li>Accelerate learning and innovation</li>
            <li>Make informed, data-backed decisions</li>
            <li>Foster a culture of curiosity and continuous improvement</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 id="dguide-principles-use-visual-artifacts">Use
                    Visual Artifacts</h3>

        <p>How do we bring our product vision to life? At DeftAgile,
            visual artifacts are crucial in enhancing communication, collaboration, and
            overall product development. They’re the tools that ensure we’re all speaking
            the same language, whether we’re aligning stakeholders, iterating on ideas, or
            ensuring both business and technical perspectives are incorporated.</p>

        <p>From Wireframes and Sketches to Prototypes and UI Flows,
            visual tools serve distinct purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Wireframes: Low-fidelity representations outlining
                structure and layout, used early in discovery for alignment.</li>
            <li>Sketches: Informal, hand-drawn visuals that facilitate
                brainstorming and rapid ideation.</li>
            <li>Prototypes: Interactive or non-interactive models to test
                usability and validate design choices before full development.</li>
            <li>Mock-ups: High-fidelity, static visual representations for
                conveying detailed design elements to stakeholders.</li>
            <li>UI Flows: Diagrams that map out user navigation, ensuring
                seamless user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other tools include Flowcharts, Sequence Diagrams,
            Workflows, and Use-Cases, each supporting specific goals, whether it's mapping
            complex processes, defining system interactions, or understanding the user’s
            journey. These visualisations help teams optimise workflows, improve user
            experience, and keep everyone aligned.</p>

        <p>But remember, don’t go overboard with visuals. Not every
            product development stage requires a visual artifact, just use the ones that
            truly add value and clarity.</p>

        <h3 id="dguide-principles-continuous-discovery">Continuous
                    Discovery</span></h3>

        <p>Continuous discovery is essential for staying aligned with
            user expectations throughout the product lifecycle. It’s not about conducting
            research only at the beginning of a project; it’s an ongoing dialogue with
            customers. Regular, weekly feedback enables product teams to refine ideas,
            adapt quickly, and deliver better outcomes.</p>

        <p>Core areas of focus in discovery include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Personas: Who are our users?</li>
            <li>Value Proposition: What do they need?</li>
            <li>Usability: Can they easily access the value we offer?</li>
            <li>Expected Outcomes: Did we meet their needs?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By integrating customer insights into our development
            cycles, we ensure that both discovery and engineering work toward solving real
            problems.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 id="dguide-principles-quad-track-agile">Quad Track
                    Agile (4-Way Agile)</h3>

        <p>Quad Track Agile is a step forward from dual-track agile,
            adding another layer of rigour to how we manage discovery and development. By
            splitting both discovery and engineering into distinct tracks, we gain a
            clearer understanding of the scope and workload involved, while leveraging data
            and AI to optimise our processes.</p>

        <p>This framework doesn’t mean creating four separate teams;
            it’s about having a single team working across four parallel tracks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Problem Space: consumer research Engaging with customers
                through surveys, interviews, and case studies. Forming hypotheses etc</li>
            <li>Solution Space Hypothesis Testing &amp; Validation: Using
                experimental design to validate assumptions.</li>
            <li>Development/Engineering: Building and releasing working
                software.</li>
            <li>Deployment/Delivery: Managing DevOps, automation, and
                continuous delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The goal is to reduce time-to-market while maintaining
            alignment between customer needs and product development. Synchronising these
            tracks allows for the efficient flow of validated ideas into development. These
            tracks are there for the purpose of the application of data in our product pipeline

        <h3 id="dguide-principles-jtbd-okrs">JTBD
                    &amp; OKRs</span></h3>

        <p>The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework helps us understand the
            true needs behind customer behaviour. Rather than focusing on the product, we
            focus on the job the customer is trying to achieve. By uncovering unmet needs,
            we drive innovation and create value.</p>

        <p>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are the framework we use
            to track progress and align efforts with strategic goals. Each quarter, we set
            clear objectives and measurable key results, ensuring that everything we do is
            aligned with the overall business strategy and customer value.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 id="dguide-principles-value-driven-decision-making">Value-Driven
                    Decision Making</h3>

        <p>Prioritising features based on their value to customers is
            key. We align these decisions with both JTBD and OKRs, ensuring that every
            feature we develop directly contributes to the customer’s needs and the
            business’s objectives.</p>

        <p>Techniques like WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) and the
            100 Dollar Test help us evaluate which features provide the highest value,
            enabling us to allocate resources efficiently and maximise impact.</p>

        <p>AI is transforming the product development process. From
            analysing customer feedback to automating tasks, AI empowers teams to work
            smarter and faster. By incorporating AI at various stages. Be it during research,
            design, development, testing, and DevOps. The aim is to enhance efficiency and
            effectiveness.</p>

        <p>AI can help us:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Identify emerging customer needs</li>
            <li>Generate product ideas during discovery</li>
            <li>Automate repetitive tasks</li>
            <li>Personalise user experiences</li>
            <li>Predict potential bottlenecks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By leveraging AI-driven analytics and machine learning, we
            make better decisions and create more intelligent, responsive products.</p>

        <p>DeftAgile isn’t just about Agile practices; it’s about
            breaking down silos between teams. By fostering cross-functional collaboration,
            we ensure that discovery, engineering, and design teams are working as one
            cohesive unit. This eliminates handoffs, reduces dependencies, and accelerates
            product development.</p>

        <p>We aim to integrate user research with technical
            feasibility, running experiments within iteration cycles to quickly validate or
            invalidate ideas. This approach makes us agile, responsive, and focused on
            continuous learning.</p>

        <p>It’s critical to identify and address impediments,
            bottlenecks, handoffs, and dependencies as soon as they arise. If left
            unchecked, these issues can slow down development and disrupt the flow of work.
            By fostering clear communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement, we
            make sure that our workflow remains optimised, and we stay on track to deliver
            high-value products.</p>

        <p>Product managers and stakeholders
            should support product owners with the synchronisation of product backlogs with

            <p><b>DeftAgile Circle (Team)</b></p>

            <p>Recognising that every organisation has its own operating
                model, DeftAgile is built around a team structure that seamlessly integrates
                discovery and delivery into one empowered unit. The goal? A versatile
                cross-functional circle capable of experimenting, innovating, and consistently
                delivering product-market fit solutions to bespoke customer needs. So, <i>what
                    is a circle?</i> A sociocratic circle is a semi-autonomous, self-organising
                team within a organisation, responsible for a specific domain of work and
                linked to other circles by at least two members (a leader and a delegate) to
                ensure effective information flow and decision-making throughout the whole
                system</p>

            <p><b>3 Core Roles in a Deft Circle</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deft Team (Engineers, Designers, Data Scientists, AI Specialists)</li>
                <li>Iteration Manager / Facilitator</li>
                <li>Product Operations / Product Owner / Product Manager
                    (Context-dependent)</li>

            <h3 id="dguide-circle-deft-team">1. Deft Team</h3>

            <p>This is the delivery powerhouse of the DeftAgile model. It’s
                composed of engineers, designers, data scientists, and AI specialists who
                collaborate closely across the product lifecycle. From ideation to iteration,
                their focus is on creating meaningful, user-centric value which are powered by
                rapid feedback loops and a culture of experimentation.</p>


            <p><i>Why it matters</i>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Integrates diverse expertise into one delivery rhythm</li>
                <li>Builds features grounded in evidence, not assumption</li>
                <li>Enables fast feedback and continuous learning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="dguide-circle-product-operations">2. Iteration Manager / Circle Facilitator</h3>

            <p>More than a Scrum Master. This role fuels team momentum by facilitating
                ceremonies, unblocking flow, and fostering a rhythm of sustainable delivery.
                They blend Agile facilitation with Lean adaptability to ensure every cycle is
                focused and efficient.</p>

            <p><i>Why it matters</i>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cultivates psychological safety and continuous improvement</li>
                <li>Keeps the team aligned and velocity high</li>
                <li>Ensures delivery cadence doesn’t sacrifice discovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="dguide-circle-product-operations">3. Product Operations / Product Owner / Product Manager</h3>

            <p>This is the strategic integrator. Whether playing a tactical
                PO role or broader PM role, this person connects business intent with user need
                and delivery execution. They manage scope, evolve the roadmap, and ensure the
                team’s backlog is always pointed at the highest-value outcomes.</p>

            <p>Why it matters:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Acts as the team’s voice of the customer and voice of the business</li>
                <li>Translates learning into roadmap signals</li>

            <p><b>A Circle Built on Sociocratic Principles</b></p>

            <p>DeftAgile teams are inspired by sociocratic design:
                self-managing circles that decentralise authority and elevate participation.
                Each Circle operates autonomously within its domain, using consent-based
                decision-making and shared accountability to guide the work.</p>

            <p><b>Key characteristics</b>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Cross-functional
                        by default</b>: Skills are shaped around outcomes, not job titles</li>

                <li><b>Double-linking</b>:
                    Circles are connected via elected leaders and delegates to ensure two-way flow
                    of context and intent</li>

                <li><b>Inclusive
                        governance</b>: All voices are heard, and policies are shaped collaboratively</li>

            </ul>

                     Circle Roles in Sociocracy DeftAgile</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Nominated Leader: Overseas operations in the circle. He/she brings in
                    strategic direction from the wider org; typically aligns with the Product
                    Owner/Product Operation Manager (depending on your context) he is also the
                    impediment buster.</li>
                <li>Nominated Delegate: Carries the team’s perspective into broader forums.
                    They are also expected to represent the circle in product operation meetings.</li>
                <li>Story Owners(optional): responsible for embedded micro-teams within
                    the Circle, each focused on specific outcomes.  They are often called upon
                    to be involved in discovery activities.  Their services are often required
                    during Innovation Studio Sessions if the Circle (team) are too busy to
                    attend.</li>

                    src="./images/deftagileguide/image005.png" alt="Visualize sociocratic team topology diagram">
            </p>

            <p>Pods are autonomous sub-teams composed of developers,
                testers, designers, and a dedicated Story/Feature Owner. Each pod operates like
                a focused mini-squad, driving a discrete stream of work from end to end.</p>

            <p><b>Pod Structure</b>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>2–4 developers</li>
                <li>1 QA or tester</li>
                <li>1 designer or UX partner</li>
                <li>1 Story/Feature Owner (acts as pod lead)</li>
            </ul>

            <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;
margin-left:36.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><b>Strategic benefits</b>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Focus</b>: Tighter ownership over features or domains</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b>: Lower coordination overhead, faster decision-making</li>
                <li><b>Quality</b>: Deep domain expertise and clearer accountability</li>
                <li><b>Ownership</b>: Story Owners champion outcomes, not just delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><b>Story Owners: Distributed Accountability</b></p>

            <p>A Story Owner takes end-to-end responsibility for a user
                story, feature or a functionality. They don’t do all the work, but they ensure
                it moves forward by making sure its cleared, delivered, and validated.</p>

            <p><b>Responsibilities</b>:</p>

            <p>1. <b>Clarification</b>: Ensure understanding and alignment
                with acceptance criteria</p>

            <p>2. <b>Leadership</b>: Coordinate teammates in the pod for
                cohesive delivery</p>

            <p>3. <b>Tracking</b>: Maintain story status and progress in
                the delivery tool</p>

            <p>4. <b>Communication</b>: Surface blockers and align with
                stakeholders early</p>

            <p><b>Impact</b>:</p>

            <p>Promotes individual accountability, accelerates throughput,
                and ensures user stories don’t drift or stall. By embedding ownership into the
                pods, teams maintain clarity even in high-complexity environments.</p>

            <p><b>Visualising a Deft Circle in Action</b>:</p>

            <p>Deft Circle</p>

            <p><i>Pod A</i></p>

            <p>└── Story Owner → Set of User Stories/Features</p>

            <p><i>Pod B</i></p>

            <p>└── Story Owner → Set of User Stories/Features</p>

            <p>Each pod operates within the circle with shared purpose,
                supported by decentralised leadership and unified by product vision.</p>

            <p>The DeftAgile Circle is more than a team, it is also a
                dynamic, self-managed unit designed to thrive in complexity. By blending
                sociocratic structure with Agile execution, it enables organisations to scale
                with autonomy, move with clarity, and innovate with integrity.</p>

            <p>Circle team’s full participation is expected during Innovation
                Studio Sessions, however due to deadlines or work spillovers. It might make
                sense for a pod within the team to attend those sessions whilst the other pod
                continues with iteration objectives.  This practice should be kept to the minimum,
                as we expect the entire team to be present for both Innovation sessions and
                innovation planning workshops</p>

            <h2 id="group-deftagile-3-vs-of-innovation">The 3 Vs
                of Innovation</h2>

            <p>At DeftAgile, innovation isn't a buzzword it is also a
                working principle. It powers how we design, deliver, and adapt. Whether we’re
                refining product features, imagining the next frontier, or exploring new
                ventures, innovation underpins our every move.</p>

            <p>We define innovation as the intentional, experimental
                implementation of ideas, fuelling both incremental improvements and
                transformative shifts. It’s about delivering greater value in an ever-evolving
                market, and enhancing user experiences by thinking one step ahead.</p>

            <p>Our early flagship formats i.e. Innovation Studio Sessions
                and Product Experiments in Practice are built on this philosophy. And in the
                words of Kevin Dame (UX Director at YouTube), innovation breaks down into three
                distinct but interwoven modes: Versioning, Visioning, and Venturing.</p>

            <p><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Versioning:
                            Evolving the Now</span></i></b></p>

            <p>Versioning is the discipline of deliberate, incremental
                change, by building on what works. It’s iterative by nature, rooted in user
                feedback, and tuned for continuous value delivery. From agile retrospectives to
                incremental release cycles, this mode is core to managing brownfield products.</p>

            <p>Think bug fixes, UX enhancements, feature rollouts. It’s not
                about disrupting markets, it’s about making your product indispensably better
                with every sprint.</p>

            <p><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Visioning:
                            Envisioning the Next</span></i></b></p>

            <p>Visioning is strategic foresight made real. It asks, where
                are we going and what might the world look like when we get there?  This mode
                challenges assumptions, reframes possibilities, and fuels paradigm-shifting
                innovations.</p>

            <p>It’s where strategy meets imagination. Apple’s focus on
                experience design or Google’s pursuit of ambient computing are visioning in
                action, which are shaping futures we didn’t know we needed, but now can’t live
                without.<br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Venturing:
                            Exploring the Unknown</span></i></b></p>

            <p>Venturing extends beyond the core business to explore
                adjacent or brand-new opportunities. It’s about experimentation at the edges, partnering,
                prototyping, and investing in unproven but high-potential ideas.</p>

            <p>Picture Google's Project Loon helium balloons delivering
                internet to remote regions. Born from Google X, it’s a classic venture move:
                high risk, potentially world-changing reward.</p>

            <p>Venturing thrives on cross-pollination and external
                collaboration. It’s how mature orgs stay agile, and how startups punch above
                their weight.</p>

            <p>By integrating all three Vs into our approach, DeftAgile
                empowers teams to innovate with purpose by balancing short-term improvements
                with long-term bets. It’s not just about doing things differently; it’s about
                doing the right things, differently.</p>

            <p><b>What are Deft Seasons and Episodes?</b></p>

            <p>A <b>Deft season</b> is a timeboxed period that serves as a
                container for all Deft episodes, providing structure and focus throughout the
                product development cycle.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Agile</b> → <b>DeftAgile</b></li>
                <li><b>Iteration or Sprint</b> → <b>Season</b></li>
                <li><b>Agile Team</b> → <b>Circle</b></li>
                <li><b>Events, Ceremonies, or Meetings</b> → <b>Episodes</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Deft episodes are a collection of meetings designed to
                facilitate teamwork and alignment, ensuring that teams collaborate cohesively
                and efficiently. These episodes form the backbone of Deft’s ways of working,
                ensuring teams stay focused on delivering the right value to customers. Each
                episode plays a crucial role in coordinating how business, product, and
                engineering teams plan, collaborate, communicate, and deliver products and
                services. Seasons, or iterations, hold these episodes together, helping teams break
                down large tasks into manageable, timebound goals.</p>

            <p><b>Deft Season (Iteration)</b></p>

            <p>A Deft season, or iteration, is where validated hypotheses
                are transformed into product increments that provide measurable value. Our
                iterations can vary in length from 1 to 4 weeks, depending on the team's
                capability to deliver incremental value to either internal or external
                customers.</p>

            <p>Each season includes 4 key episodes:</p>

            <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
                <li><b>Innovation Studio Session</b></li>
                <li><b>Innovation Planning Workshop</b></li>
                <li><b>Daily Check-ins</b></li>
                <li><b>Review &amp; Retrospective</b></li>
            </ol>

            <p>The success of DeftAgile hinges on the availability of the
                right stakeholders, including subject matter experts (SMEs). Having the right
                people in the room for these episodes is critical to driving innovation and
                delivering value. A defining feature of DeftAgile is the integration of AI and
                data throughout the product lifecycle, which supports innovation and
                decision-making across all episodes.</p>

            <p>Innovation Studio Sessions are highly structured, timeboxed
                events aimed at sparking creativity and accelerating collaboration. These
                sessions bring together discovery and delivery teams in a focused environment
                where they can explore innovative ideas, rapidly prototype solutions, and
                validate high-potential opportunities.</p>

            <p>The sessions emphasise lean innovation practices,
                incorporating insights from users, technical feasibility, and business
                viability. Teams engage in divergent thinking, prototype development, and
                iterative testing to reduce uncertainty and speed up the learning process.</p>

            <p><b>Key Advantages</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>No Handoffs</b>: Discovery and delivery teams
                    collaborate directly, ensuring alignment and seamless communication.</li>
                <li><b>Continuous Collaboration</b>: Both discovery and
                    delivery activities overlap, allowing teams to work in parallel and make
                    faster decisions.</li>
                <li><b>Short Feedback Loops</b>: Prototypes are quickly tested
                    and refined, reducing the risk of missteps.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This episode sets the tone for the entire iteration cycle by
                energising the team, fostering collaboration, and focusing on value-driven
                outcomes.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Unlike traditional iteration planning meetings, DeftAgile’s
                Innovation Planning Workshop is a collaborative, creative session that brings
                together product operations, engineering teams, and SMEs. Rather than focusing
                solely on the &quot;why&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, and &quot;how&quot;, DeftAgile
                takes it a step further. This workshop allows teams to bring validated ideas
                into visual form, including wireframes, prototypes, and data-driven plans. AI
                plays a significant role in this process, helping teams to experiment,
                innovate, and visualise iteration goals more effectively. This workshop is
                outcome focused, meaning, by the end there must be an evolving end to end
                solution. The idea is to create an early prototype of a potentially shippable
                product that can be reviewed before the end of the iteration.</p>

            <p><b>Iteration Types</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>3/7 Iteration</b>: A 2-week iteration comprising a
                    3-day Innovation Planning Workshop and a 7-day development cycle.</li>
                <li><b>5/15 Iteration</b>: A 4-week iteration comprising a
                    5-day Innovation Planning Workshop and a 15-day development cycle.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Advantages</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Two Feedback Loops</b>: In a 2-week iteration,
                    stakeholders have two opportunities to review progress: once during the
                    planning workshop and again after the development cycle. <i>Why two? <b>(1)</b>
                    </i>a quick showcase of an end-to-end evolving solution and <b><i>(2)</i></b>
                    during the review</li>
                <li><b>Three Feedback Loops</b>: In a 4-week iteration, stakeholders
                    have three opportunities to review progress, enabling continuous alignment
                    with the product vision. <i>Why three</i>? <b>(1)</b> is reviewing the
                    outcome of the innovation planning workshop <b>(2)</b> and at the end of
                    the iteration which is the Iteration review. <b>(3)</b>  this is usually
                    at the end of the second week at of the iteration.  This is to make sure
                    that there would be no surprises that might derail the delivery of the
                    iteration goal. The shorter the feedback loop for a 4-week sprint, the
                    better.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style='margin-left:36.0pt'><b>Remember</b>:  This is for the
                sole purpose of notifying stakeholders of the work in progress or done.  This
                is usually done during the daily check-ins.</p>

            <p>AI accelerates development by automating tasks such as code
                generation, testing, and debugging. This allows teams to focus more on creative
                work rather than repetitive tasks.</p>

                <p>The goal of an <b>Innovation Iteration Planning</b> session
                    is to develop a functional MVP or prototype within a few days. Teams use AI
                    tools to accelerate prototyping, and the final output can evolve into a
                    shippable product increment.</p>

                <p>During the session, cross-functional teams collaborate to
                    prototype core e-commerce features, using AI tools to speed up tasks like
                    content generation, image optimisation, and even basic UI/UX design. This
                    ensures that stakeholders can review the evolving solution, providing valuable
                    feedback before full development begins.</p>

                    <p><b>DeftAgile Scaled Product Framework (Sociocratic Model)</b></p>

                    <p>Deft has adopted a sociocratic, double-linking hierarchy
                        model which is the fundamental practice for connecting different levels of an
                        organisation. It's how adjacent circles (the equivalent of teams or departments)
                        are linked, ensuring smooth communication and effective decision-making.  Our
                        scaling product model are centred around product category groupings that shares
                        common characteristics (attributes), functions or target audiences</p>

                    <p>This linking is achieved through two key roles:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Leader (or it could be the Facilitator): This individual
                            is a full member of both their own circle and the circle directly above or
                            below it. They typically guide the discussions and processes within their
                            own circle while also bringing information and decisions to the linked
                            circle.</li>
                        <li>Delegate: The delegate is also a full member of both their
                            own circle and the linked circle. Their primary role is to represent the
                            voice and concerns of their circle to the linked circle, ensuring that
                            information flows upwards and downwards effectively.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This dual connection creates a powerful feedback loop,
                        preventing circles from operating in isolation. It fosters transparency,
                        promotes shared understanding, and helps maintain the organisation's overall
                        coherence<b>.</b></p>

                        agile practice designed to proactively manage and resolve dependencies between

                        resolve interdependencies. This practice fosters transparency and reduces

                            in SAFe or Sprint Planning in Scrum.</li>
                        <li>Participating Teams:
                            Cross-functional teams, including product, engineering, DevOps, QA, and
                            other stakeholders, come together to identify and resolve dependencies.</li>
                        <li>Marketplace Concept:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams offer services, expertise, or resources that can help unblock
                            others.</li>

                        <li>Teams also request support, resources, or deliverables they need
                            to progress their work.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol start=4 type=1>
                        <li>Collaborative Problem-Solving:
                            Teams work together to negotiate timelines, responsibilities, and
                            solutions for identified dependencies.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>How it Works:</p>

                    <ol start=1 type=1>
                        <li>Dependency Identification:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each team prepares a list of dependencies before the marketplace
                            event. These could be technical, resource-based, or process-related.</li>

                        <li>Dependencies are categorised (e.g., blockers, critical,
                            non-critical) for prioritisation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol start=2 type=1>
                        <li>Presentation and Discussion:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams present their dependencies in a shared forum.</li>

                        <li>Other teams assess if they can help resolve these dependencies or
                            negotiate timelines for delivery.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol start=3 type=1>
                        <li>Prioritisation and Agreement:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Dependencies are prioritised based on their impact on the
                            product's delivery or customer outcomes.</li>

                        <li>Teams align on action items, owners, and deadlines for resolving
                            each dependency.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ol start=4 type=1>
                        <li>Follow-Up and Tracking:</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Action items from the marketplace are tracked in a shared tool
                            (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps).</li>

                        <li>Progress is reviewed during regular stand-ups or retrospectives.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Value of the Dependency
                        Marketplace:</p>

                    <ol start=1 type=1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transparency: Teams gain
                                visibility into cross-functional needs, reducing surprises during
                                development.</li>
                            <li>Efficiency: Proactively
                                managing dependencies minimises delays caused by misalignment or
                                bottlenecks.</li>
                            <li>Collaboration: Encourages open
                                communication and teamwork across product discovery and engineering teams.</li>
                            <li>Accountability: Clear ownership
                                and deadlines ensure dependencies are resolved promptly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Example:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Team A needs API access from
                            Team B to develop a new feature.</li>
                        <li>Team B offers a delivery
                            timeline but also highlights that they need infrastructure support from
                            Team C.</li>
                        <li>All three teams collaborate in
                            the marketplace to adjust timelines and align dependencies, ensuring
                            smooth progress.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In essence, the Dependency
                        Marketplace turns dependency management into a collaborative and transparent
                        process, fostering alignment across teams while minimising risks and delays.</p>

                        Meeting &amp; Workshops</h3>

                    <p>Our meeting and workshops are designed with the purpose of
                        facilitating collaboration between product, business and delivery teams, but
                        mainly focusing on discovery and development.  We believe that it is the
                        responsibility of strategic teams to meet frequently so that they can provide
                        guidance to tactical teams, which in turn allow focus mainly on the creation of
                        product and services without being distracted by counterproductive meetings. 
                        It is important to stress on the point that meetings and workshops are largely
                        dependent on organisational needs. DeftAgile are not in the business of
                        prescribing any type of meetings. However, we implore tailoring them according
                        to organisational structure, culture and skills available.  Below are some
                        examples of meetings that will help organisations to move from ideas down the
                        value streams into finished products</p>

                        <p>To make data-driven decisions in Agile iterations, customer
                            data (e.g., behaviour analytics, feedback, A/B tests) should directly influence
                            Innovation Iteration Planning, Daily Check Ins, Iteration Review, and
                            Retrospective. Below is an example using our fictitious e-commerce site.</p>

                        <p>Data Used:</p>

                        <li>Conversion rates: Only 30% of users who add items to cart
                            complete checkout.</li>

                        <li>Heatmaps: Users abandon carts at the shipping options page.</li>

                        <li>Customer surveys: Complaints about unclear delivery costs.</li>

                        <p>Iteration Goal:</p>

                        <p><b><i>&quot;Reduce cart abandonment by streamlining the
                                    checkout process, starting with shipping cost transparency.&quot;</i></b></p>

                        <p>Iteration Backlog:</p>

                        <li>Redesign checkout to show shipping costs upfront (A/B test two
                            versions).</li>

                        <li>Add a progress bar to indicate checkout steps.</li>

                        <li>Fix a bug causing slow loading on the payment page (from past
                            iteration’s performance data).</li>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><b>2. Daily Check-ins (Tracking Iteration Metrics)</b></p>

                        <p>Data Discussed:</p>

                        <li>A/B Test Progress: Version A (shipping costs upfront) has a 12%
                            lower abandonment rate than Version B (costs at the end).</li>

                        <li>Performance Metrics: Payment page load time improved from 4s →
                            1.5s after bug fix.</li>

                        <li>Customer Support Tickets: 20% decrease in &quot;unexpected
                            shipping cost&quot; complaints since the change.</li>

                        <p>Adjustments Made:</p>

                        <li>Pivot fully to Version A of checkout.</li>

                        <li>Dev team allocates time to further optimise mobile checkout.</p>

                            <p><b>3. Iteration Review (Validating Outcomes with Data)</b></p>

                            <p>Results Presented:</p>

                        <li>Cart abandonment dropped from 70% → 58% after shipping cost
                            transparency.</li>

                        <li>Conversion rate increased by 8% for users seeing Version A.</li>

                        <li>Negative Feedback: Some users want more payment options (from
                            post-checkout surveys).</li>

                        <p>Next Steps:</p>

                        <li>Prioritise adding PayPal &amp; Apple Pay in the next iteration.</li>

                        <li>Investigate why mobile conversions lag behind desktop.</li>

                        <p>Important Bits:</p>

                        <li>Cycle Time: Checkout redesign took 20% longer than estimated due
                            to unexpected UI conflicts.</li>

                        <li>Customer Sentiment: Net Promoter Score (NPS) improved from +32 →
                            +41.</li>

                        <li>Missed Opportunity: Didn’t analyse returning vs. new user
                            behaviour differences.</li>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Actionable Improvements:</p>

                        <li>Break UI tasks into smaller stories next iteration.</li>

                        <li>Segment data by user type (new vs. returning) in future tests.  <br>

                        <p>How Airbnb embedded data into Agile workflows to scale
                            decision-making:</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>1. Cross-Functional Data Teams</p>

                        <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>a.<span
                                style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tactic:
                            Embedded data scientists in Iteration teams (e.g., pricing algorithm engineer
                            paired with product managers).</p>

                        <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>b.<span
                                style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Impact:
                            Improved host acceptance rates by 4% through real-time A/B tests on ranking
                            algorithms.</p>

                        <p>2. Hypothesis-Driven Experiments</p>

                        <p>Example: Tested &quot;hearts vs. stars&quot; for Wishlist’s.
                            This simple UI change increased engagement by 30%.</p>

                        <p>Process:</p>

                        <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>a.<span

                            metrics upfront (e.g., &quot;Increase guest bookings by 15%&quot;).</p>

                            small-scale tests before full rollout.</p>

                        <p>3. Balancing Data with Creativity</p>

                        <p>Philosophy: &quot;Data-informed, not data-driven”.</p>

                        <p>Used qualitative insights (e.g., host interviews) to compliment
                            A/B tests (e.g., professional photography program doubled bookings).</p>

                        <p>4. Scaling Trust with Data</p>

                        <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>a.<span
                                style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trust
                            Signals: Verified IDs and reviews increased bookings by 12%.</p>

                                style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tool:
                            Built internal dashboards to monitor host/guest behaviour trends.</p>

                        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

                        <p>By embedding customer data into each Iteration event in our
                            e commerce website, decisions are grounded in real user behaviour and not
                            assumptions. The next Iteration could focus on mobile optimisation and payment
                            options, continuing the cycle of data-driven improvement.</p>

                        <p>Integrating customer data into DeftAgile Episodes is more
                            than just about improving products, it’s about making every decision more
                            informed, more relevant, and more aligned with real customer needs. By
                            grounding each stage of the lifecycle in data-driven hypotheses, we ensure that
                            our product teams are working with the best possible insights at every moment.</p>

                        <p>This approach doesn’t just give product managers and Agile
                            teams confidence in their decisions, it also accelerates the product
                            development process, improves user satisfaction, and drives measurable<b> </b>business
                            outcomes. Whether you're refining a feature or validating a new idea, applying
                            customer data ensures you're always on the right path.</p>

                        <p>At DeftAgile, we don’t just innovate; we innovate with
                            purpose by using customer data to guide every decision and deliver true value.</p>
